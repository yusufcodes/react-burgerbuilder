## Introduction

This repo is an extension of **this main repo** where I am learning how to use React. This is the first big project so I wanted to use a different repo to document and keep track of it.

## Section 8: A Real App: The Burger Builder (Basic Version)

### Setting up the Project + Creating a Layout Component

Burger and BurgerIngredient components were created, followed by the CSS needed to render a burger.
